;Duckstation Cheat File
;**********************
;
; To edit this file I recommend Notepad++ and set up a user defined language
; for the cheat File as it helps readability.
;
;1. Start any comment lines with a semi-colon, this can be useful to split up
;   sections of cheats to improve readability as well as adding comments to
;   aid in understanding of the cheats. These comments do not appear in
;   Duckstation so remember to keep explanations in cheats for users. Try to
;   keep comment lines under 80 characters
;
;2. Cheat Naming conventions for multiplayer games is 'Px Cheat Description'
;   where x is the player number. Eg. P1 Infinite Lives. If the cheat is for all
;   players or you have only tested it for P1 then don't mention P1 eg
;   'Infinite Lives'
;
;3. Try to order cheats in a logical order if possible, like so:
;   * Cheats for all Players for all levels
;   * Cheats for P1 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P2 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P3 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P4 for all levels
;   * Cheats for all Players for level 1
;   * Cheats for P1 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P2 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P3 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P4 for level 1
;   * Cheats for all Players for level 2
;   * Cheats for P1 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P2 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P3 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P4 for level 2
;     repeat for other levels
;   * Cheats that you don't want to appear in the above list, I think this
;      should be kept for Debug Mode Cheats, 60FPS Cheats and the like.
;
;4. Cheats should be grouped if possible and worthwhile using the backslash '\'
;   character. Especially true for cheats that poke the same address(es) with
;   different value(s). This will make the cheat menus easier to skip long
;   option lists when you only need to enable one option.
;
;5. Header format:
;  ; [ Game Name (Region) (Year) (Publisher) {GAME_ID Numbers} <mameshortname> ]
;  :GAME_ID1
;  :GAME_ID2  <--repeat as necessary
;
; Well that's the plan anyway....let's see how it tracks out  Pugsy, 04 DEC 2020

;
;  Register Code Types
;  *******************
;  These codes utilise the internal global 256 32-bit cheat registers. As they
;  are global they will work across all cheats for a game so be careful not
;  to re-use registers unintendingly. Type 51 codes can be used to copy and
;  manipulate register contents between registers and memory. Type 52 codes are
;  block conditionals that you can test the registers with and branch accordingly.
;
;  These code types will only need to be used with very advanced cheats, only
;  use them if you need them as they may blow your mind....
;
;  General Notes:
;  ==============
;  RegXX or RegYY means the immediate value of the register
;  (RegXX) or (RegYY) means the indirect value of the register = contents of the
;                     address held in RegXX or RegYY
;  TTTTTTTT = Write to Address TTTTTTTT
;  (TTTTTTTT) = Read from Address TTTTTTTT
;  ZZ,ZZZZ,ZZZZZZZ = Value
;  Note RegXX, RegYY, RegWW can be the same register
;
